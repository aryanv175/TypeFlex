TypeFlex: Use Text Replacement and increase your productivity with TypeFlex!


**Scalability**: 

TypeFlex is a very widely scalable product.

It can be used by:

Business professionals: They will be able to save a common email template as a shortcut and avoid having to copy and paste it everytime.
Students: When applying to various job opportunities, they can create shortcuts for their linkedin, gitub or potfolio website's url.
Event Organizers: As it goes in every event, the organizer is asked the same question over and over again. Which can lead to frustration but this again can be avoided by simply creating shortcuts for the important pieces of information. Such as, the Schedule of the event etc.
These are just a few examples. The potential of this software is limitless.


**Revenue Model**:

We will be implementing the simple, yet successful, Freemium model for TypeFlex. 

There will be two tiers a free tier and a paid tier.

The free tier will have a few limitations such as: 
1) A limit on the number of shortcuts that can be made eg. 25 shortcuts.  
2) The number of characters in the shortcuts created by the user eg. maximum 250 characters.

The paid tier will overcome these shortcomings, giving the user the full potential of the software at a fixed monthly fee.
