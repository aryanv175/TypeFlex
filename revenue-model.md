We will be implementing the simple, yet successful, Freemium model for TypeFlex. 

There will be two tiers a free tier and a paid tier.

The free tier will have a few limitations such as: 
1) A limit on the number of shortcuts that can be made eg. 25 shortcuts.  
2) The number of characters in the shortcuts created by the user eg. maximum 250 characters.

The paid tier will overcome these shortcomings, giving the user the full potential of the software at a fixed monthly fee.
