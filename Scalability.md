TypeFlex is a very widely scalable product. 


It can be used by:
1) Business professionals: They will be able to save a common email template as a shortcut and avoid having to copy and paste it everytime.
2) Students: When applying to various job opportunities, they can create shortcuts for their linkedin, gitub or potfolio website's url.
3) Event Organizers: As it goes in every event, the organizer is asked the same question over and over again. Which can lead to frustration but this again can be avoided
                     by simply creating shortcuts for the important pieces of information. Such as, the Schedule of the event etc. 
                   
                   
                   
These are just a few examples. The potential of this software is limitless.
